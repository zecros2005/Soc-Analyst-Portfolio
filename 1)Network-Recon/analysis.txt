Lab: Network Recon – Linux → Windows VM

Objective:
- Detect and analyze reconnaissance activity (port scanning) from a Linux VM targeting a Windows VM.

Tools:
- Nmap (Linux VM)
- Wireshark (Windows VM)

Steps:
1. Ran `nmap 192.168.56.102 from Linux VM.
2. Captured incoming packets on Windows VM using Wireshark.
3. Filtered TCP SYN packets: tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0
4. Observed network behavior.

Observations:
- Multiple TCP SYN packets sent to different ports.
- Short intervals between packets.
- Closed ports responded with RST; open ports may respond with SYN/ACK.
- Pattern indicates reconnaissance / port scanning activity.
